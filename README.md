# JPRO-InfoHub
In today's educational landscape, efficient and streamlined student registration and management processes are critical for educational institutions to effectively manage their student population. So, we also started a project to change our school’s management system to modern technology. Our project name is JPRO InfoHub and it is a student registration and course information system application. By using the JPRO InfoHub, the user can register students and maintain the detail information of students. In addition to this, not only students but also teachers' information can be added, and the courses and batches opened in the school can also be added. And then the user can also register students' payments and any data of the system can be easily managed. In the case of UI design, simple and attractive designs have been added to make it for user-friendly. For the color, it is based on the theme of JPRO by using red, white, black and lead color.
